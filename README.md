Building is one of the easiest ways to get the tools without installing as
library. You can build it almost on anything, just make sure there were no
errors on installing reqs (network, click).

Building windows executable (if you dont trust auto winbuild.bat)
```batch
  pip install network
  pip install click
  pip install pyinstaller
  pyinstaller --onefile --clean --add-data LICENSE;. --add-data README.md;. -i assets/images.ico LetsConnect.py
```
  Building Linux executable (if you dont trust auto linbuild.sh)

  pip install network
  pip install click
  pip install pyinstaller
  pyinstaller --onefile --clean --add-data LICENSE:. --add-data README.md:. -i assets/images.ico LetsConnect.py
